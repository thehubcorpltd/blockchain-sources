# TheHUB Blockchain Sources

TheHUB decided to open-source our blockchain source system in order to enable anyone to add projects and coins inside the website.

This means that will be no fees to integrate your favourite project and this will enable you and your users to create personal VPS and deploy up to 6 instances in the same machine.
But there's even more, if you enable the developer mode you will be able to enter your VPS and use it for personal or developing purposes.

If you don't know what TheHUB is you can enter our [website](https://thehub.host) or our platform [here](https://app.thehub.host).

## How the integration works

As you can see you have two simple JSON files that describes to our scripts how the blockchain works and where the informations will be fetched. A third file is `additional_configurations`. That file will be included at the end of your `coin.conf` file.

To start the integration simply fork this repository, add your project and open a PR. Our admins will check if the integration works and if everything is working as expected your project will be integrated to the master branch and in TheHUB too.
